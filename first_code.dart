/*function when a fuctiin is part of an object it is called a method.
function allow programme to broken down into small callable units.
The parentheses after fuction contain parameters, and the code within curly bracket is executed when a fuction is called.
function parameter become variable within a function.
Local variable have a scope that is limited to block of code within which they are defined.
This means that they can only be accessed from within that block.
The variable defined in main() function can not be accessed in any other fuction.
